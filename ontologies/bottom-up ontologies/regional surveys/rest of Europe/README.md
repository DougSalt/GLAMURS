+ [regional-roe.owl](regional-roe.owl) - this is based on the coding for the regional surveys for the rest of Europe. The rest of Europe being the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain. 
+ [kb-regional-roe.owl](kb-regional-roe.owl) - this is the same as regional-roe.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value.
