# GLAMURS ONTOLOGIES

This is the repository for all ontologies created during the [GLAMURS project](http://glamurs.eu/).

The directory structure is the following:

+ **docs**  - This contains all documentation used to enhance this presence in github. The main project web page is here along with style sheets and images need to render the page.
+ **ontologies** - As the directory name implies this contains all the ontologies. The actual directory contains other directories containing component ontologies and their respective, common ontologies. In particular the global ontology for the GLAMURS project is present in this directory. 
+ **src** - This contains the source for the programs that did the automatic ontology generation.

For more detail on what and how the ontologies were constructed, then please consult the **ontologies** directory.
