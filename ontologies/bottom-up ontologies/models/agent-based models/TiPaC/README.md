This directory contains the TiPaC traffic model ontologies:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [tipac.owl](tipac.owl) - this is the original ontology produced automatically against the TiPaC model.
+ [mirror-tipac.owl](mirror-tipac.owl) - this is the same as tipac.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
