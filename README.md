# GLAMURS

This is the repository for all ontologies created during the [GLAMURS project](http://glamurs.eu/).

Essentially this site is a set of directories containing a series of directories, each leaf directory containing a single ontology and common roots containing any commonly included ontologies or integrated ontologies.

The structure is essentially the following

+ **docs**
+ **integration ontology** - This directory contains all the ontologies linking the other ontologies together and the linking vocabulary ontologies themselves.
+ **bottom-up ontologies** - This contains all the ontologies created for each major deliverable of the project
	- *original description of work ontology* - this is the ontology created from the description of work at the start of the project -
	- *expert vocabulary* -
	- *glossary* -
	- *high frequency terms* -
	- *on-line questionnaire* -
+ **top-down ontologies** - This contains ontologies created from the description of work and the ontologies created from text mining the GLAMURS documentation corpus.
