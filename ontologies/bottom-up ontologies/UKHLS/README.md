This directory contains the UK horizontal logitudinal study ontologies:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [ukhls.owl](ukhls.owl) - this is the original ontology produced by referring to the coding for the UKHLS.
+ [mirror-ukhls.owl](mirror-ukhls.owl) - this is the same as ukhls.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
