+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [sna-roe.owl](sna-roe.owl) - this is based on the coding for the social networking analyses for the rest of Europe. The rest of Europe being the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain. The social networking analysis was of the key actors in each of the regional case studies/iniatives studied in GLAMURS.
+ [mirror-sna-roe.owl](mirror-sna-roe.owl) - this is the same as sna-roe.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process..
