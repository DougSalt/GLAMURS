        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The methodology for the creation of this ontology is as follows:

1. Run ./filter_for_valid_glossary.pl glossary.txt global.raw.csv, where glossary.txt contains all the glossary single words,
    word groups and abbreviations; global.raw.csv is a file that contains all possible single words, 2 and 3 word groupings.
   This program will then output in RDF/XML format a bunch of individuals for inclusion in an OWL file. These represent
   single-words in the glossary that have exceeded e^^4 and word groups in the glossary with e^^3.
2. The glossary was then gone through assigning the definition of each term to an institution (this is easy because it
     is listed in the glossary). 
3. Additional information is then sort from the top-terms and online-questionnaire ontologies to see if this can provide
    any further, definition informaiton.
4. All aditional axioms are interpretation of the author of this ontology over the latest version of the official GLAMURS
    glossary.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Note the conventions for this ontology are:

The underlying name of an entity, i.e. a class, object, datatype or property name is in Camel Case and should indicate the purpose of the entity. This is opposed to some ontologies which randomly name the entity and purely use the label to identify the entity in some meaningful way.
 
+ classes begin with an upper case letter
+ object properties begin with a lower case letter
+ data properties begin with a lower case letter and are suffixed with -value unless the data value is boolean.
+ data properties and object properties being with has unless another verb makes better sense.
+ individuals gerneally begin with a lowercase letter, unless it is a proper name

Note these conventions relate to the underlying entity and not what is shown as its name in Protégé (which is normally the value of the label for whatever default the language is set to).

+ a label must be provided (usually with a language specification) and should be make sense in the language of choice

Markdown will be used in all text.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Refers broadly to a bundle of data and methods representing an entity residing within the dynamic simulated system. Examples of possible agents include: individuals (e.g., consumers and producers); social groupings (e.g., households, firms, communities, and government agencies); institutions (e.g., markets and regulatory systems); biological entities (e.g., crops, livestock, and forests); and physical entities (e.g., infrastructure, weather, and geographical regions). Agents can also be composed of other agents, permitting hierarchical constructions. In various degrees, agents are capable of:

+ adaptation to environmental conditions,
+ social communication with other agents,
+ goal-directed anticipatory learning, and
+ autonomy (self-activation and self-determinism based on private internal processes), (Borril &amp; Tesfatsion, 2011).

Other names that refer to it are “consumption based emissions” or “consumer emissions”. The total global long-lived greenhouse gas emissions of a system is aggregated using 100-year global warming potential (see Global Warming Potential (GWP)), hence, greenhouse gases with various radiative properties are compared and weighed for a time horizon of 100 years.</rdfs:comment>

A class can be considered as a label for a set of individuals - for example, the class of Adults (by convention classes are given an initial capital letter) is the class of Persons who are 18 or more years old. As the above example shows, classes can be subclasses of each other (Adults are a subclass of Person because all Adults are persons).

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Footprint analyses can allocate total environmental footprints among categories of consumption, typically Food, Shelter, Mobility, Goods (Manufactured Goods, Clothing etc.) and Services. Consistent categorization across studies allows for comparison of the footprint of individual consumption components across regions, and the relative contribution of each category to the region’s overall footprint. To avoid double counting of environmental impacts coming from the production of goods and services, it is important that consumables are allocated to only one consumption category</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Coping is expending conscious effort to solve personal and interpersonal problems, and seeking to master, minimize or tolerate stress or conflict. The effectiveness of the coping efforts depend on the type of stress and/or conflict, the particular individual, and the circumstances (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)). We distinguish 2 broad types of coping strategies:

+ problem-focused: Directed towards reducing or eliminating a stressor, adaptive behavioural.
+ emotion-focused: Directed towards changing one&apos;s own emotional reaction (also via challenging one&apos;s own assumptions).

For Glamurs, coping strategies are relevant in terms of dealing with internal conflicts, time scarcity, difficulties in adopting a sustainable lifestyle, or dealing with certain governance policies.</rdfs:comment>

The individual members of multi-person households are not treated as separate institutional units, because many assets are owned and liabilities incurred jointly. Moreover, many expenditure decisions, e.g. relating to the consumption of food or housing, may be made collectively. This is why the household must be treated as an institutional unit. A person living alone may also constitute a household.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&quot;A lot of research has been carried out focusing on the relations between social capital and subjective wellbeing. Helliwell (Helliwell, 2001) for instance argues that social capital has substantial effects on wellbeing, and also Diener and Suh (Diener et al., 1997) emphasize the importance of social relations related to subjective wellbeing. […] Social capital generally represents the degree of social cohesion which exists in communities (WHO, 1998) and encompasses networks, together with shared norms, values and understandings which facilitate cooperation within or among groups (OECD, 2001). However, there is a broad variety of definitions related to “social capital”. Coleman (Coleman, 1988) describes social capital as a variety of different entities with two common elements: social structure and certain actions of actors within the structure, which includes vertical (bridging) as well as horizontal (bonding) associations. Social capital is closely linked to existing ties in terms of closeness, kindness, or support, to norms in terms of obligatory rights and duties as well as to mutual trust. On the individual level, social capital is used in order to maximize the level of individual happiness. On the societal level (communities, etc.), social capital is developed and applied in order to assure adequate functioning of societal processes. Social capital can be seen as a measure for the number and strength/intensity of social relationships and can be examined on three levels: the micro-level, the meso-level and the macro-level (Gehmacher et al., 2006).&quot; (Grünberger &amp; Omann, 2011).

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">We adopt the same definitions from psychology, i.e. descriptive, injunctive, subjective. However, when capturing social norms within a framework of utility maximisation we cannot distinguish between these different norms. The gain/loss in utility from compliance/non-compliance relates to all three norms depending on the context. Social norms are generally incorporated within the utility function as the negative of the distance function (absolute or squared) between the individual’s choice variable (to be decided as an outcome of the utility maximisation process) and the norm.  Modelled in this way means that a choice variable different to the norm generates negative utility whereas perfect compliance implies a zero negative term</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Philosophy: The attribution of a specific degree of importance to a need or strategy or to a set thereof. In this regard, sustainable development is a value as it confers high importance to specific strategies to particularly meet the needs of PROTECTION and AFFECTION (Rauschmayer et al., 2011). Psychology approach: Values are general preferences for end states or ways of acting; they serve as goals and guiding principles that apply across different contexts and underlie more specific attitudes, preferences, and behaviours. Values vary inter-individually and intra-individually (between situations) in their importance. Examples for values are: beauty, peace, and wealth (Clayton, 2009) (Schwartz, 1992, p. 21). For Glamurs, it is important to be clear of whether we mean 

a) the importance of a need, or
b) general preferences for end states or ways of acting/ guiding principle, and whether
c) we refer to values of individuals and/ or social entities (initiatives,…)?

For empirical work (e.g. task 5.2) the psychological definition seems appropriate, for conceptual work (e.g. parts of task 3.3) the transition science definition seems appropriate.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The volume of water consumed as a result of the delivery of a set of goods or services for final consumption, expressed in cubic meters (m3). The indicator reflects water use for agriculture and livestock, manufacturing, electricity and the direct demand for water. The water footprint can be calculated for blue water (surface, e.g. river and lakes, and groundwater), green water (rainwater), and grey water (freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants) consumption/extraction</rdfs:comment>
