This directory contains the ontologies for Bath University micro-economic models:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [ubah.owl](ubah.owl) - this is the original ontology produced for this model, directly from the applicable documentation. 
+ [kb-ubah.owl](kb-ubah.owl) - this is the same as ubah.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
