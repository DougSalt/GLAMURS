This directory contains the social networking analysis for Scotland ontologies:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [sna-sco.owl](sna-sco.owl) - this is based on the coding for the social networking analysis for Scotland. The social networking analysis was of the key actors in the Scottish case study into flexibile working.
+ [mirror-sna-sco.owl](mirror-sna-sco.owl) - this is the same as sna-sco.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process..
