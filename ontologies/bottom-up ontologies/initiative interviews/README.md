This directory contains the initiative interview ontologies:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [initiative.owl](initiative.owl) - this is the original ontology produced by referring to the coding for the case-study interviews. That is key stakeholders in each of the regions environmental initiatives were inteview, using the coding scheme upon which this ontology is based. 
+ [kb-initiative.owl](kb-initiative.owl) - this is the same as initiative.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
