This directory contains the ontologies for Tilburg University macro-economic models:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [tsc.owl](tsc.owl) - this is the original ontology produced for this model, directly from the applicable documentation. 
+ [mirror-tsc.owl](mirror-tsc.owl) - this is the same as tsc.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
