This directory contains the back-casting ontologies:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [backcasting.owl](backcasting.owl) - this is the original ontology produced by reading the back-casting analysis document for the Netherlands. Back-casting is a workshop process in which the ends are defined, and then the conditions required for those conditions are determined.
+ [kb-backcasting.owl](kb-backcasting.owl) - this is the same as backcasting.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
