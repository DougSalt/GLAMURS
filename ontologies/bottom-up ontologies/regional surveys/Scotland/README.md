This directory contains the regional-sco interview ontologies:

+ [README.md](README.md) - this file.
+ [regional-sco.owl](regional-sco.owl) - this is the original ontology produced by referring to the coding for the case-study interviews. That is key stakeholders in each of the regions environmental regional-scos were inteview, using the coding scheme upon which this ontology is based. 
+ [mirror-regional-sco.owl](mirror-regional-sco.owl) - this is the same as regional-sco.owl, except each of the classes, object properties and data properties have been converted into term individuals and classified as either a class, and object property or data value. This is for the purpose of reasoning over connections between ontolgies in a later part of the process.
