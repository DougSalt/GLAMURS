Annotation(rdfs:comment "Note the conventions for this ontology are:

The underlying name of an entity, i.e. a class, object, datatype or property name is in Camel Case and should indicate the purpose of the entity. This is opposed to some ontologies which randomly name the entity and purely use the label to identify the entity in some meaningful way.
 
+ classes begin with an upper case letter
+ object properties begin with a lower case letter
+ data properties begin with a lower case letter and are suffixed with -value unless the data value is boolean.
+ data properties and object properties being with has unless another verb makes better sense.
+ individuals gerneally begin with a lowercase letter, unless it is a proper name

Note these conventions relate to the underlying entity and not what is shown as its name in Protégé (which is normally the value of the label for whatever default the language is set to).

+ a label must be provided (usually with a language specification) and should be make sense in the language of choice

Annotation(rdfs:comment "The methodology for the creation of this ontology is as follows:

1. Run ./filter_for_valid_glossary.pl glossary.txt global.raw.csv, where glossary.txt contains all the glossary single words,
    word groups and abbreviations; global.raw.csv is a file that contains all possible single words, 2 and 3 word groupings.
   This program will then output in RDF/XML format a bunch of individuals for inclusion in an OWL file. These represent
   single-words in the glossary that have exceeded e^^4 and word groups in the glossary with e^^3.
2. The glossary was then gone through assigning the definition of each term to an institution (this is easy because it
     is listed in the glossary). 
3. Additional information is then sort from the top-terms and online-questionnaire ontologies to see if this can provide
    any further, definition informaiton.
4. All aditional axioms are interpretation of the author of this ontology over the latest version of the official GLAMURS
    glossary."@en)

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :agents "Refers broadly to a bundle of data and methods representing an entity residing within the dynamic simulated system. Examples of possible agents include: individuals (e.g., consumers and producers); social groupings (e.g., households, firms, communities, and government agencies); institutions (e.g., markets and regulatory systems); biological entities (e.g., crops, livestock, and forests); and physical entities (e.g., infrastructure, weather, and geographical regions). Agents can also be composed of other agents, permitting hierarchical constructions. In various degrees, agents are capable of:

+ adaptation to environmental conditions,
+ social communication with other agents,
+ goal-directed anticipatory learning, and
+ autonomy (self-activation and self-determinism based on private internal processes), (Borril & Tesfatsion, 2011).

# Individual: :socialCapital (Social capital)

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :socialCapital "\"A lot of research has been carried out focusing on the relations between social capital and subjective wellbeing. Helliwell (Helliwell, 2001) for instance argues that social capital has substantial effects on wellbeing, and also Diener and Suh (Diener et al., 1997) emphasize the importance of social relations related to subjective wellbeing. […] Social capital generally represents the degree of social cohesion which exists in communities (WHO, 1998) and encompasses networks, together with shared norms, values and understandings which facilitate cooperation within or among groups (OECD, 2001). However, there is a broad variety of definitions related to “social capital”. Coleman (Coleman, 1988) describes social capital as a variety of different entities with two common elements: social structure and certain actions of actors within the structure, which includes vertical (bridging) as well as horizontal (bonding) associations. Social capital is closely linked to existing ties in terms of closeness, kindness, or support, to norms in terms of obligatory rights and duties as well as to mutual trust. On the individual level, social capital is used in order to maximize the level of individual happiness. On the societal level (communities, etc.), social capital is developed and applied in order to assure adequate functioning of societal processes. Social capital can be seen as a measure for the number and strength/intensity of social relationships and can be examined on three levels: the micro-level, the meso-level and the macro-level (Gehmacher et al., 2006).\" (Grünberger & Omann, 2011).

However, when capturing social norms within a framework of utility maximisation we cannot distinguish between these different norms. The gain/loss in utility from compliance/non-compliance relates to all three norms depending on the context. Social norms are generally incorporated within the utility function as the negative of the distance function (absolute or squared) between the individual’s choice variable (to be decided as an outcome of the utility maximisation process) and the norm.  Modelled in this way means that a choice variable different to the norm generates negative utility whereas perfect compliance implies a zero negative term"@en)

In this regard, sustainable development is a value as it confers high importance to specific strategies to particularly meet the needs of PROTECTION and AFFECTION (Rauschmayer et al., 2011). Psychology approach: Values are general preferences for end states or ways of acting; they serve as goals and guiding principles that apply across different contexts and underlie more specific attitudes, preferences, and behaviours. Values vary inter-individually and intra-individually (between situations) in their importance. Examples for values are: beauty, peace, and wealth (Clayton, 2009) (Schwartz, 1992, p. 21). For Glamurs, it is important to be clear of whether we mean 

a) the importance of a need, or
b) general preferences for end states or ways of acting/ guiding principle, and whether
c) we refer to values of individuals and/ or social entities (initiatives,…)?
